🎈 Little Learners Emporium
An Interactive Web-Based Toy Store for Kids and Parents

👶 About the Project
Little Learners Emporium is a vibrant and interactive toy store designed for children aged 0–8 and their parents. The goal is to create a playful yet educational online space where early learning meets fun.

The platform allows parents to easily browse, filter, and select educational toys while giving kids a safe and cheerful experience with games and engaging visuals.

🧠 Problem Statement

Educational game integration

Multi-angle toy previews

Color psychology-based design

Ratings and reviews from other parents

Build a fun, responsive toy catalog with age-based filtering
